## 🚀 Installation

Install UltraTerminalAI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g uvm-terminal-ai
```

Once installed, start the AI terminal assistant by running:

```bash
uvmai
```

---

## ⚙️ API Setup

UltraTerminalAI requires an **API key** to connect with the UltraVM AI service.

### 🪄 Generate a new API key
Run:
```bash
/getapi
```

This will create a new API key and show it on your screen.  
Use this key to activate your access and start using the AI.

### 🔑 Use an existing API key
If you already have an API key from a previous session or plan, use:
```bash
/setapi <your_api_key_here>
```

## 💳 Billing & Management

UltraTerminalAI runs on the **UltraVM AI Platform**, and each user requires an active plan to access AI tokens.

### 🌐 Billing Portal
Visit the official billing portal to:
- Purchase or renew your AI plan  
- Manage your existing API keys  

👉 **[https://billing.ultravm.tech](https://billing.ultravm.tech)**

Once a plan is purchased, your API key will automatically get activated.  
If you lose access, you can always generate a new one with `/getapi`.
